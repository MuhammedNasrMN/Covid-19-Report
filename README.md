#This is a Covid-19-Report Dashboard, The first dashboard is a global Covid-19 report, While the second is a report about Egypt's covid-19 Situation and how it impacted it's economy
I got the data from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus

Data Preparation

I used Python to seperata/ remove any unnecessary data
I then used python to add Indexes to each country
I then used Excel power query to split the report into 2 files, and to trim any unnecessary columns

Data Exploration 

I got the cleaned files to MySQL and used MySQL benchwork to explore the data and gain some insights,
using SQL for this project wasn't necessary becasue the data size didn't require it, but I wanted to have some real hands on experience with SQL with actual data.

Data Visualization

Lastly I used Power BI to create new measures & visualize the data.
